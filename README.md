I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science, and I have previously earned a Bachelor's degree in Commerce
with concentrations in Marketing and Medical Informatics. Throughout my academic journey, I have acquired proficiency in
various programming languages and data analysis tools, including Python, R, SAS, Weka, and Tableau. These courses and
learning experiences have equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of the data analysis field, enabling me to

and skills applicable to projects and tasks in different fields.
